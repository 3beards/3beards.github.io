      <p>Brew Dog can lay legitimate claim for having revolutionised the craft beer industry in the UK. By injecting pure punk ideology with a great product, fearless marketing and some zero bullshit approach to getting things done. James talks from the heart with a fierce pride of his success, and making Ben feel uncomfortable on several occassions. No punches pulled.</p>

      <p>Cory is a highly succesful author and the long time editor and founder of BoingBoing. A talk that widely ranges across various ideas and themes concerned with the future, humans and machines. Ben found Cory to be mindblowing in his range of thoughts, though he's not sure how much he always agreed with where his mind rockets landed nor the implications of them. One for the futurists.</p>

      <p>3 Black Cab drivers on stage, with a beer, and a propensity to talk - expect a lot of laughter. A raucous evening of incredible stories, football banter, as 3 cabbies couldn't quite believe their luck. Filmed at the peak of Hailo this is a wonderful snapshot of happier times, but we're glad to know they'll have hopefully done very well indeed.</p>

      <p> With Rohan fresh out of Number 10, Ben sat down with his old boss to talk about life, politics, and the future of entrepreneurship. This was a delightful interview, and we managed to get some great stories out of it - some of which were only permitted to be heard in the room and not committed to camera. Ben makes no apologies for his affection for Rohan, so don't expect a Paxman interview.</p>
